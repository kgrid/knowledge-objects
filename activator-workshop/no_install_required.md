# No Install Required Version of the Knowledge Grid Activator


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you interacting with a version of the Knowledge Grid Activator which is hosted remotely at http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/health . 

### Prerequisites

* [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) - Must be updated to version 8


### Interacting with the Activator
**Step 1** Navigate to your browser and check the status of the remotely hosted activator.

If working properly, the "Number of objects on the shelf" should be 41. This is the number of Knowledge Objects available for use.


## Interacting With a Knowledge Object

A list of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPICÂ®) guidelines can be found in knowledge object form in the [Knowledge Grid Library](http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/library2/#/). This tutorial will be using two objects authored for determining Codeine reccomendations based on the CYP2D6 gene, which can be found [here](https://umich.box.com/v/CPICKnowledgeObjects).


For MacOS users, the following cURL commands can be run directly from the command line. If you are working in a Windows or Linux environment, naviagate to https://onlinecurl.com/ in your browser and copy the below commands directly (no need to include your email address to use this website). 


**Step 2** Open the command line (MacOS Users).

**Pre-Written Commands**

Use a cURL Command to get CPIC Object #1, this is the object that maps genotype to phenotype for the CYP2D6 gene.
```
curl -X GET \
  http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/knowledgeObject/ark:/99999/fk49z9gr7p \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: 1e486f30-ba1b-4b05-a94f-f0a70cc578bc'
```


Use a cURL Command to get CPIC Object #2, this is the object that returns Codeine dosing recommendations based on the CYP2D6 gene information.
```
curl -X GET \
  http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/knowledgeObject/ark:/99999/fk4mc97w6m \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: 85b5ac3f-b886-4b58-ace9-397fe7741c0f'
```



Use a cURL Command to engage CPIC Object #1.
```
curl -X POST \
  http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/knowledgeObject/ark:/99999/fk49z9gr7p/result \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: b944f1d5-d34a-4182-8bbf-9a3a8f25a25d' \
  -d '{"diplotype":"","allele1":"*3","allele2":"*3"}'
```



Use a cURL Command to engage CPIC Object #2.
```
curl -X POST \
  http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/knowledgeObject/ark:/99999/fk4mc97w6m/result \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: ef25c4be-8dc6-4365-88de-8705015b77d9' \
  -d '{"phenotype": "Normal metabolizer", "choice":"1"}'
```
