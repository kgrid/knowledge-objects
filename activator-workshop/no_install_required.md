## Interacting With a Knowledge Object

A list of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPICÂ®) guidelines can be found in knowledge object form in the [Knowledge Grid Library](http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/library2/#/). This tutorial will be using two objects authored for determining Codeine reccomendations based on the CYP2D6 gene, which can be found [here](https://umich.box.com/v/CPICKnowledgeObjects).


For MacOS users, the following cURL commands can be run directly from the command line. If you are working in a Windows or Linux environment, naviagate to https://onlinecurl.com/ in your browser and copy the below commands directly (no need to include your email address). 



Use a cURL Command to get CPIC Object #1, (what it does....)
```
curl -X GET \
  http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/knowledgeObject/ark:/99999/fk49z9gr7p \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: 1e486f30-ba1b-4b05-a94f-f0a70cc578bc'
```


Use a cURL Command to get CPIC Object #2, (what it does....)
```
curl -X GET \
  http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/knowledgeObject/ark:/99999/fk4mc97w6m \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: 85b5ac3f-b886-4b58-ace9-397fe7741c0f'
```



Use a cURL Command to engage CPIC Object #1, (what it does....)
```
curl -X POST \
  http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/knowledgeObject/ark:/99999/fk49z9gr7p/result \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: b944f1d5-d34a-4182-8bbf-9a3a8f25a25d' \
  -d '{"diplotype":"","allele1":"*3","allele2":"*3"}'
```



Use a cURL Command to engage CPIC Object #2, (what it does....)
```
curl -X POST \
  http://kgrid.med.umich.edu/stack2/knowledgeObject/ark:/99999/fk4mc97w6m/result \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: ef25c4be-8dc6-4365-88de-8705015b77d9' \
  -d '{"phenotype": "Normal metabolizer", "choice":"1"}'
```
